                <h2 class="text-highlight">Design Decisions</h2>
                <h3>Where Design influences came from</h3>
                I explored colour palettes on <a href="https://coolors.co/" class="text-highlight">coolors.co</a> and
                found the current colour scheme there. I was going for a dark neon theme, I implemented this by creating
                the
                'text-highlight' class. I found the 'Red Hat Mono' font by
                looking through google fonts and seeing which one I liked the most.
                <h3>Creating the Index Name Animation</h3>
                First, I used a fading transition from a lighter purple, to a darker purple. This is still used in this
                page, under the class "text-highlight". Then I decided to use a 3D glitch effect, having inspiration
                from <a href="https://codepen.io/longfurbyqueen/pen/YLdVjw" class="text-highlight">here</a>. To create a
                similar effect, I decided to use a ::before and ::after pseudoelement. I created
                animations to move them slightly towards the original word, so it will have a cool seperating effect.
                <h3>Creating the Navigation Bar</h3>
                My first step was to create the HTML for the bar. Originally the hamburger menu was a link, however this
                would not work when i clicked it. I did some research and decided to use a checkbox, as it would work
                the same. Then I used the :focus selector to check if it was selected, and change the navbar display
                from none to flex. This means it would show when the checkbox was clicked. To style it like a hamburger
                menu, I used a pseudoelement and gave it content "â‰¡". I also made animation on hover, using transition
                to slowly highlight, instead of instantly.

                    <div class="log-item">
                        <h3>12/03/23</h3>
                        <p>I created a base index.html and set up my personal access token for authentication. I also
                            added
                            a
                            navbar
                            and main section to the index.html.</p>
                        <img src="images/image4.png" alt="code snippet">
                    </div>
                    <div class="log-item">
                        <h3>15/03/23</h3>
                        <p>I created a base portfolio.html, it followed the same layout as index.html with the navbar
                            being
                            at
                            the top and then the main content following. I've decided that every webpage will follow
                            this
                            structure and only the main content will be different.</p>
                        <img src="images/image2.png" alt="code snippet">
                    </div>
                    <div class="log-item">
                        <h3>16/03/23</h3>
                        <p>I created the contact page.</p>
                        <img src="images/image1.png" alt="code snippet">
                    </div>
                    <div class="log-item">
                        <h3>17/03/23</h3>
                        <p>I created the base for the work experience page.</p>
                        <img src="images/image5.png" alt="code snippet">
                    </div>

                        <h3>19/03/23</h3>
                        <p>I created the base for the site report page. I also decided to add a h1 element to each
                            webpage
                            to
                            give it a more visual title.
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/image6.png" alt="code snippet">
                    </div>
                    <div class="log-item">
                        <h3>22/03/23</h3>
                        <p>I used an <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" class="text-highlight">html validator</a> to
                            validate
                            my code. I then fixed every error that was found in the html.
                        </p>
                        <p>I also styled the navabr and decided to start thinking about responsivity. I did this by
                            adding
                            an
                            import statement that would only run on large screen sizes.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="log-item">
                        <h3>23/03/23</h3>
                        <p>I made a new branch called index-styles. In this branch I styled the homepage and created an
                            animation.
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/image7.png" alt="code snippet">
                    </div>
                    <div class="log-item">
                        <h3>24/03/23</h3>
                        <p>I created a new branch called contact-styles.
                            I then created an animation for highlighted text.
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/image3.png" alt="code snippet">
                        <p>I then styled the contact info and form sections. After completing this I merged the branch
                            with
                            master.
                            I then created a new branch called portfolio-styles and then styled the portfolio page.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="log-item">
                        <h3>25/03/23</h3>
                        <p>I created a branch called experience-styles and styled the work experience page. After
                            completing this I merged the branch with master.
                            I then went on to create a branch called sitereport-styles and styled the siterport page.
                        </p>
                        <p>I then created a new branch called responsive styles, here I worked on the responsitivity of
                            the website on smaller screens.
                            After completing the styles, I then validated all the css files using this <a
                                href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" class="text-highlight">css validator</a> and
                            fixed all errors.
                        </p>
