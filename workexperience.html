                <h3>May 2021 - July 2021</h3>
                <p>I did a remote internship with Brainnest, a consulting company based in Germany. I worked
                    as a junior analyst. The experience was remarkable. I worked with different people from all over the
                    world. I attached the certificate I received on the last page on my curriculum vitae.
                    Below I have listed a few things I learned working there:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discern product confusion from bugs, determine solutions, and advise the sales team advertisers
                        to accomplish the advertisers desired outcome.
                    </li>
                    <li> Develop deep knowledge within a complex product group.</li>
                    <li>Investigate and prioritise advertising issues, raising to a specialist when appropriate for further troubleshooting or debugging.</li>
                </ul>
